# Project Movies

This week we were building multi page application using React Router and how to pass information that we then pick up in router to load dynamic content. Also this week we started learning on styled components.

## The problem

I did not have bigger problem, usual lack of time to focus on everything i wanted. Would focus more on styled components.
